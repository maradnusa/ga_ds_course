DS | Unit Project 4

### PROMPT

In this project, you will make use of the skills you learned from Projects 1-3, and include an executive summary of your analysis. Your goal is to prepare a Jupyter Notebook, combining deliverables similar to that in projects 1-3 with an appendix and executive summary. This will be a final overview of your analysis that incorporates past feedback and demonstrates your approach.

**Goal:** Using the titanic dataset, make use of the methods used in projects 1-3 to write a problem statement, perform exploratory data analysis, run a model, and write up an executive summary that outlines your findings.

### DELIVERABLES

#### Jupyter Notebook

- **Requirements:**
  - Executive summary
  -  Problem statement
    -  “Specific aim”
    -  Articulation of datasets
      - Include external sources of information used to understand the datasets if any
    -  Risks and assumptions
    -  Hypotheses
  -  Exploratory data analysis with visualizations and statistical analysis
  - Data cleaning
    - Drop missing data
  - Modeling
    - What model(s) do you want to use? Why?
    - Will you tune your model(s)? If so, how?
    - What are the metrics of your model?
  - A writeup on the interpretation of findings including conclusions and next steps
    - How good is your model?
    - What metrics are you using to score your model?
    - How do you interpret the results of your model?

- **Bonus:**
    - Instead of dropping all missing data, consider which fields can be imputed. How would you impute them? (If you have time, try running your model on the imputed dataset.)
    - Run a decision tree classification model on your dataset and visualize it
      - For visualization purposes, consider setting your max depth to no more than 5.

### EVALUATION

Your project will be assessed using the following standards:

- Identify Problem
- Parse Data
- Mine Data
- Refine Data		
- Model Data
- Present Results

#### Rubric: [Click here for the complete rubric](./project4-rubric.md).

Requirements for these standards will be assessed using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While your total score may serve as a helpful gauge of whether you've met project goals, __specific standards scores are more important__ since they can show you where to focus your efforts in the future!

### RESOURCES

#### Dataset  
We'll be using the titanic dataset. There are several resources online detailing the fields of the dataset, and we will leave it to you to find the appropriate explanations. __Do include your sources in your notebook.__

Dataset: [titanic.csv](./assets/titanic.csv)

#### Starter code
Open the [Jupyter Notebook](./starter-code/project4-starter.ipynb) and follow the questions provided.

#### Suggestions for Getting Started

- Review your previous work and any prior instructor feedback.
